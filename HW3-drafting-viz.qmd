# Questions

### Which option do you plan to pursue?

I plan to pursue option 1

### Restate your question(s). Has this changed at all since HW #1? If yes, how so?

What groups of environmental defenders are being killed on a larger scale than others and by whom?

The initial questions I was interested in looking into were the victims age and gender, as well as the connections between the industry driver and the perpetrators of their deaths.

### Explain which variables from your data set(s) you will use to answer your question(s).

I will use person_characteristics, number_of_victims, and perpetrator_type

# Visualization adaptations/inspiration

1.   <https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/environmental-activists/numbers-lethal-attacks-against-defenders-2012/>

From these graphs, I'd like to adapt the interactive element, being able to hover over the points and view the names/information of the victims

1.  <https://github.com/Ijeamakaanyene/tidytuesday/blob/master/outputs/2020-17_plants_in_danger.png>

From this graph, I want to look into borrowing how the creator lists each species labled by region in Africa, grouped by the years and apply that to representing the victims from my dataset

# Questions

### What challenges did you encounter or anticipate encountering as you continue to build / iterate on your visualizations in R?

My biggest challenge was in understanding how to deal with total counts of victims and how to represent each individual as a data point in my first visualization. An interactive scatter plot was the best idea I had to display that, but due to how the data is structured, plotting this led to issues that would either obscure/remove victims entirely or misrepresent certain characteristics, like age. In the first graph, I used age as my Y variable, but due to the nature of the data, many victims ages were unknown and left as NA values. To allow these people to still be represented, I changed it to a 0 value, but that's not a metric I'd like to represent the victims with for my final graph.

I also had trouble with plotting the sankey diagram and figuring out scaling so the text/labels don't flow over the borders/ the text isn't too small to fit in the squares.

A challenge i anticipate encountering as I build on this is finding the right balance between making an informative and visually appealing graph while also maintaining respect for the people who's data I'm using

For the barchart, I also struggled with rordering the factor levels of the bars, even after modifying the data to a factor from a character.

### What ggplot extension tools / packages do you need to use to build your

ggalluvial and highcharter are two packages I'll be using that we haven't covered in class

### What feedback do you need from the instructional team and / or your peers to ensure that your intended message is clear?

I'd like feedback on how to create an emotional impact with the visualizations. I'd also like feedback on the clarity of the variables I'm using and if more information is needed to understand the context behind my question/the dataset itself. Based on feedback I got from Sam, I'll be looking into making a visualization similar to the "Plants in Danger" chart seen in week 8 lecture
